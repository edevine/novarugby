<h2>Family Fund FAQ</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>What activities will the fund support?
    <dd>The NOVA Family Fund is designed to provide a revenue source to help pay for fields, youth team grants, coaching stipends, player and coaching clinics, travel
        expenses to Nationals and other long-term club needs.
    <dt>Who oversees the fund?
    <dd>The NOVA Board of Governors (BOG), a body of elected club members from the men’s and women’s teams, will have discretion over the use of funds. Individual teams
        must submit requests to the BOG, in writing, to access the fund and a majority of BOG members must approve the request.
    <dt>How much should I donate?
    <dd>NOVA asks that all current players, alumni and parents of alumni donate a tax-deductable $100 contribution each year.
    <dt>What do I get for my donation?
    <dd>Those who donate will receive a newsletter, NOVA merchandise, and soon will have access to video of team matches on our website.
    <dt>How will NOVA collect the funds?
    <dd>The Board of Governors has selected JustGive.org, a nationally respected non-profit organization, whose main purpose is to help other non-profit groups to raise
        money. JustGive.org collects donations, delivers a tax receipt to you the donor and provides NOVA with a list of donors. For more information about JustGive.org,
        please click <a href="http://www.justgive.org/about-us/index.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <dt>How much does JustGive.org charge for the service?
    <dd>JustGive.org collects 3% of donations to cover the transaction costs, a price comparable to other online services.
    <dt>Will this fund replace player dues?
    <dd>Absolutely not. Those club members who reap the fun and direct benefits of being on the pitch will still pay dues and volunteer at club fundraising events, to pay
        for their games, parties and most of their equipment.

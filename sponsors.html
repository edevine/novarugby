    <h3>O'Sullivan's Irish Pub</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.osullivansirishpub.com">www.osullivansirishpub.com</a>
    <p> Opened in 2006, this family owned and operated pub epitomizes what an Irish bar should be. Irish owners, managers and staff
        are the core of the establishment, and coupled with traditional Irish food and drinks, it has established itself as the
        'locals' bar located in the heart of Arlington.
    <p> In 2013, the pub expanded and doubled in size, adding more seating, TV's and a second bar which specializes in whiskey. Now
        boasting over 130 whiskeys, the new bar and additional dining room hasn't changed the atmosphere of O'Sullivan's, just made
        it bigger and better.
    <p> O'Sullivan's loves to cater for events, and with live music 3 nights a week, and Trivia and Karaoke on offer too, it is the
        perfect spot for a bit of craic agus ceol!

    <h3>The Bronx Brewery</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.thebronxbrewery.com/">www.thebronxbrewery.com</a>
    <p> The Bronx Brewery is a small, craft brewery in the Port Morris section of the South Bronx. It was launched in 2011 by a
        small team with two things in common: a maniacal focus on creating high-quality beer and a passion for the Bronx and New
        York City. Its traditionally-crafted pales ales use only premium and minimally-processed materials to create fresh, bold
        beer from a borough known for its own uniquely bold character. The team is enthused to bring a rich brewing tradition
        back to the Bronx and craft a beer that the people of the Bronx and New York City can be proud to call their own. You can
        find their beers throughout New York.
